# Exploration-for-Vegetable-Classification
Train and fine tune a Image classification model to predict images of different vegetables, then evaluate our findings based on our models results.
This project uses a dataset from kaggle with hundreds of images of vegetables
After this intoduction, we will explore the data, such as the number of files split between the training, test and validation folders, image dimensions, etc
After Data Exploration, we will train, and fine tune multiple models to find which best fits our image data properly
We will evaluate the preformance of the all models. We'll look into accuracy, confusion metric, precision, recall, F1-score, precision-recall curve for the model.
We will explore examples in which our models failed to predict correctly.
